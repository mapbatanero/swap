HADOOP
	What Is Apache Hadoop?
	The Apache™ Hadoop® project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing. 
	The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.

	Conclusion
There are many ways of achieving software fail-over; Xander is just one approach. This minimal mechanism does not cater
to other related fail-over capabilities — failure recovery, load balancing, parallel processing, and the like. 
For example, should the server fail halfway through the processing, there is no built-in automatic recovery. 
Of course, you can extend Xander to provide your own recovery procedures. Also, failure is defined not as processing 
failure but hardware failure; that is, the server is assumed to be unreachable (see Figure 2). For software failures, 
you need to implement functions that detect the failure (Java's exception handling comes to mind) and activate the 
mechanism. Despite these shortcomings, Xander is a simple yet flexible implementation of a fail-over mechanism that 
can be extended and improved for other purposes.
